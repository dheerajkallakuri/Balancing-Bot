# Balancing Bot

## Overview

This project involves creating a balancing robot using the Makebot educational development kit. The robot uses a gyroscope sensor and Arduino to read and process sensor data. The program for this project is written in Scratch, a visual programming language. The gyroscope sensor provides values for the x, y, and z axes, which are used to control the motors and maintain the balance of the robot.

## Components

- **Makebot Development Kit**
- **Arduino Board**
- **Gyroscope Sensor**
- **Motors**
- **Scratch Programming Environment**

## How It Works

1. **Gyroscope Sensor**: The gyroscope sensor measures the orientation of the robot by providing values for the x, y, and z axes.
2. **Arduino Board**: The Arduino board reads the sensor data and processes it.
3. **Scratch Programming**: The Scratch program is used to interpret the sensor data and control the motors accordingly.
4. **Motor Control**: Based on the processed data, the motors adjust their speed and direction to keep the robot balanced.

## Scratch Program

The Scratch program is designed to:

1. Read data from the gyroscope sensor.
2. Calculate the necessary adjustments to the motor speeds based on the sensor data.
3. Send commands to the motors to adjust their speeds and directions to maintain balance.

## Steps to Build the Balancing Bot

1. **Assemble the Hardware**:
   - Connect the gyroscope sensor to the Arduino board.
   - Connect the motors to the Arduino board.
   - Ensure all connections are secure and the components are properly powered.

2. **Set Up the Software**:
   - Install the Scratch programming environment on your computer.
   - Write the Scratch program to read the gyroscope data and control the motors.
   - Upload the Scratch program to the Arduino board.

3. **Calibrate the Sensor**:
   - Ensure the gyroscope sensor is properly calibrated to provide accurate readings.

4. **Test and Adjust**:
   - Run the program and observe the robot's behavior.
   - Make necessary adjustments to the Scratch program to improve the balancing performance.
